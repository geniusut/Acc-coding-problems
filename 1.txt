1.       Difference between ‘this’ and ‘let’ and when to use what, explain with examples.


i)"this" keyword:
"this" keyword value depends on where it is called.

Examples
function foo() {
	console.log(this); //global object
};

app = {};
app.foo = function() {
	console.log(this); //points to app object
}

var link = document.getElementById("lid");
link.addEventListener("click", function() {
	console.log(this); //points to link
}, false);


ii)"let" keyword

let is a block scope variable which allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used

Example: 
  var count = 100;
  if (count > 20){
    let amount = 100
    console.log(amount);// print 100
  }
console.log(amount); //in the console, it returns Uncaught ReferenceError: amount is not defined.means scope limited to block level
